          %p= 'Something unique about me is that I began my professional life as a genetics researcher. I obtained my Masters in Molecular Genetics in 2014 at Kansas State University. During my freetime at graduate school I taught myself the Python coding language using local library books and internet resources. My goal was to write a couple of scripts to automate some data analysis tasks that were proving to be time consuming in the lab. It was from this humble beginning that I developed a passion for programming and led to my career change after completing my Masters. I am still fascinated by the continually evolving field of science today and think it is an extremely important subject for the populous to be educated in, but my ultimate career goals lie in software development.'

          %p= "Steryl glucosides are a common conjugate of sterols found in the plasma membranes of most plants and fungi.  The cellular functions of steryl glucosides remain largely unknown, but they have been implicated to facilitate stress response in plants, and more controversially, to serve as primers for the synthesis of cellulose.  The glycosylation of the C3 hydroxyl group of the sterol nucleus is catalyzed by UDP-glucose:steryl glucosyltransferase (UGT80) enzymes.  Two genes encoding UGT80A2 and UGT80B1 are responsible for most steryl glucoside production in Arabidopsis, while UGT80C1 presents a putative third enzyme.  Available microarray data for UGT80C1 reveals upregulated mRNA expression in response to heat and salt stress, as well as in water-imbibed seeds.  In Arabidopsis, seed imbibition signals the epidermal seed coat cells to secrete an encapsulating mucilage that consists primarily of hydrated polysaccharides.  Cellulose has also been identified in the inner layer of the mucilage, providing a convenient model to study cellulose synthesis due to its negligible effect on seed germination and the availability of pectin and cellulose staining dyes.  Preliminary data shows that imbibed ugt80A2,B1 and ugt80B1,C1 double transgenic insertion knockout seeds exhibit abnormal aggregation, while a triple mutant shows an additive effect with extreme seed aggregation.  Treatment with Na2CO3 disrupts this phenotype, but reveals irregular polysaccharide and/or cellulose patterning and deposition of the mucilage.  Analysis of the triple mutant also shows an additive effect with respect to this novel phenotype.  The preliminary results may be indicative of disrupted cellulose synthesis and a relationship between steryl glucosides and CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 5 (CESA5), which contributes to cellulose accumulation in seeds.  Confocal laser scanning microscopy with cellulose binding fluorescent dyes, calcofluor white and pontamine scarlet, confirm abnormal cellulose patterning in the triple mutant compared to wild type seed mucilage.  However, further study is needed to decipher whether the depletion of steryl glucosides influences the cellulose content in Arabidopsis seed mucilage and/or another carbohydrate component such as pectin or callose."
